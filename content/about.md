Welcome! My name is Bryan Winstead. I am currently employed as a Software
Engineer focusing on cloud infrastructure and developer platforms. My background
is largely in more customer-facing roles, like support and Technical Account
Management. I've also helped develop and design products before. Although my
background is quite varied, and I was quite resistant to it for very long, I do
feel like software is where I'm best suited. I'm currently very passionate
about:

* Kubernetes
* Engineering Productivity
* Infrastructure as Code (in particular Pulumi)
* Observability
* Reliability
* Linux (and FOSS in general)

This blog largely exists to help my organize and (hopefully) clearly articulate
my thoughts around various things. I'm also asked the same questions somewhat
frequently, and having my answer to them thoroughly documented in a single place
can help to avoid Redundancy. I'm also a huge believer in learning in public.
As I explore new technologies, I _hope_ to document my journey and learnings for
two reasons:

1. To help anyone else going through a similar journey. This is somewhat
   nebulous as software evolves incredibly rapidly over time. Blog posts can be
   amazing sources of information, but can get out of date and be dangerously
   incorrect very quickly. For that reason, I don't like documenting "steps to
   accomplish things". I tend to focus more on how and why things work at a
   fundamental level.
1. To get help, myself. If I'm doing something incorrectly or inefficiently, I'd
   very much appreciate a public correction. With the complexity and rate of
   change of modern software, it is impossible to be an expert in everything.
   Being taught by those with more experience is an invaluable way to learn
   things. So thanks in advance!

Here are some things you're likely to encounter here:

* Kubernetes
  * gitops (flux, argocd)
  * cluster api
* (neo)Vim
  * Plugins
  * Workflows/Tips
* Performance
  * Case studies (ish)
  * Tools I've found useful
* Git
  * Workflow/Tips
